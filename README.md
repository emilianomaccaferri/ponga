# ponga
a reimplementation of cloudflare tunnels

# project status

the part that worried me the most (basic tunneling) is done, but this is not what i would call a usable project (it's actually very far from it).
- [x] basic tunneling (ssh over websocket works)
- [ ] better error handling
- [ ] dynamic configuration
- [ ] jwt authentication
- [ ] github idp support
- [ ] google idp support
- [ ] web ui
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] nginx "plugin"
